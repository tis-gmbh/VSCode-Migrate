# Change Log

## 1.1.0

### ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨

- The migration script no longer has access to the Extension Host API. Migration Scripts that use it, will fail to load.

### Separate Migration Script Process

The Migration Script now runs on a separate process. This means that your migration script no longer has access to the VSCode Extension Host Process. This change was performed because of the following introduced features:

- VSCode Migrate now supports Debugging of your migration script. If you run the `Debug Migration Script` command. This will attach the debugger to the migration script process. Set breakpoints as desired and use VSCode Migrate as if you were performing the migration normally. Run `Stop Debugging Migration Script` to detach from the process.
- Long running, synchronous operations in the migration script no longer stall the extension host process.

The migration script process can be restarted using the `Restart Migration Script Process` command.
